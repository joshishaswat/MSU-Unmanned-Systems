# MSU-Unmanned-Systems

## Finished code for two projects developed in the Michigan State University Unmanned Systems team.

The following projects aid in completing missions on a fully autonomous drone:

1. image_capture.py

Primary use of auto photo capture python script is to establish a connection to the Sony Alpha 6000 with a Raspberry Pi and terminal. The script allows for a picture snap in the camera from a remote monitor. This script has been tested with success.

2. Image processing using OpenCV

The OpenCV python script isolates shapes from a plain background. This script has been successfully tested on a field of grass.
